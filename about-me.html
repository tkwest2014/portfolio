      <h4>My History</h4>
      <p>After graduating from Iowa State University, I have worked for a variety of companies in both accounting and writing.
      Today, I continue to complete freelance work for both industries.  Now, that I am learning to code, I will be able
      to expand these talents to a whole new industry.</p>
